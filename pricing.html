			      	</div> 
			    </div> 

			    <div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>How can I list products on FindLight?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>After creating your account, you can list products via our user-friendly interface. Simply log in, navigate to the <strong>'My Listings'</strong> section, and click <strong>'Add Product'</strong>. Remember, with a free account, you can add up to 10 products.</p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 
				
				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>How many products can I list under the Basic plan?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>Under the Basic plan, you can list up to 10 products at no cost.</p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>Can distributors join FindLight?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>Absolutely! We welcome both original manufacturers and resellers, including distributors. </p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>Does FindLight sell products directly?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>No, FindLight does not sell products directly. We provide a platform for suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to list and promote their products.</p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>Does FindLight charge a transaction fee if a product is sold through the platform?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>No, FindLight does not charge any transaction fees for products sold through our platform. We aim to facilitate connections between suppliers and customers without intervening in the sales process.</p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>How does the "Sales Leads" feature work, and how is it different from the Basic plan to others?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>The "Sales Leads" feature allows suppliers to receive inquiries from potential customers interested in their products. In the Basic plan, suppliers receive standard access to these leads. However, with premium tiers, due to promotional activities like premium placement, SEO optimization, and other advanced features, listed products have a higher likelihood of appearing in search results. As a result, premium tier subscribers often see increased visibility, which translates to receiving more qualified sales leads, thereby enhancing their lead activity and potential conversions.</p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>How do I decide which pricing tier is best for my business?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>Choosing the right pricing tier depends on your business needs and goals. Here's a guideline:</p>
						<p><strong>Basic Plan: </strong>Suitable for businesses looking to test the platform, offering up to 10 product listings.</p>
						<p><strong>Starter and Above: </strong>Ideal for businesses aiming for increased visibility and enhanced features. As you move up the tiers, you benefit from greater promotional activities, more product listings, premium placements, and additional marketing services.</p>
						<p>We recommend assessing the volume of products you wish to list, the level of promotion you desire, and the additional features that align with your business strategy. If unsure, our support team is available to guide you based on your objectives and budget.</p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>Can I switch between plans if my needs change?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>Absolutely! You can easily upgrade or downgrade between plans as your business needs evolve. Just access your account settings and select the desired plan. Any changes in billing will be adjusted accordingly from the next billing cycle.</p> 
					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>What benefits do I receive with the Starter or higher plans regarding product listings?</p> 
					</div> 
					<div class="accordion-answer"> 
						<p>With the Starter plan and above, you receive:</p> 
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Increased Product Listings:</strong> More products can be listed compared to the Basic plan.</li>
							<li><strong>SEO-Friendly Product Pages:</strong> Enhanced optimization to make your products more discoverable in search engines.</li>

					</div> 
				</div> 

				<div class="accordion"> 
					<div class="accordion-question"> 
						<p>What are the payment options for the different plans?</p>

However, with premium tiers, due to promotional activities like premium placement, SEO optimization, and other advanced features, listed products have a higher likelihood of appearing in search results. As a result, premium tier subscribers often see increased visibility, which translates to receiving more qualified sales leads, thereby enhancing their lead activity and potential conversions."
